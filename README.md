# Machine Learning Model Evaluation

This is a Streamlit app that demonstrates the evaluation of machine learning models using the Kannada MNIST dataset. The app allows you to select the number of components for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and choose from various models to train and evaluate.

## Dataset

The Kannada MNIST dataset is used for training and testing the machine learning models. The dataset contains handwritten digits in the Kannada script, similar to the original MNIST dataset.

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:

2. Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Select the number of components for PCA using the dropdown.

4. Choose a machine learning model from the dropdown.

5. Explore the classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC curve with AUC for the selected model.
